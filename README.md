# Shawshank Public Licence

Sometimes, we just don't care what happens to our code because we're not thinking of monitization. Sometimes, we hate to waste a good opportunity to play around with the convept of a licence. We also happen to love movies.

This licence is for developers who want to let others do what they want with their software, but also want to hear about some damn fine movies they might have missed.
